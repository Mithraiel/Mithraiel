## 🎯 Future Goals
In the next stage of my academic journey, I plan to continue at the University of Applied Sciences Munich (Hochschule München)
to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics and Design, followed by a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

My long-term vision is to cultivate what I call my Trinity of Creation —
a deep fusion of economics, technology, and art.
From my roots in business and finance, to my passion for software engineering and creative design,
I strive to build bridges between these worlds — crafting solutions that are not only functional,
but emotionally and economically meaningful.

🏆 To me, innovation is where logic, creativity, and human understanding intersect —
that’s where the real magic of technology begins.
